# projplot 1.0.0

## Breaking Changes

- Renamed the following functions:

	- `projxvals()` -> `proj_xvals()`
	
	- `generate_plot()` -> `proj_plot_show()`
	
	- `projdata()` -> `proj_data()`
	
	The inputs and outputs to these functions have also been renamed and/or otherwise changed.
	
## Enhancements
